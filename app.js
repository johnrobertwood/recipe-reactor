//Get the food and quantity inputs and assign them to variables
//Assign the button to a variable
//Assign the parent elemnt in the table to variable

//Create an add row function that builds up a table row by appending data cells with each column value

//Create an edit function that selects the parent node of the button
//then swaps the p value with the input value if you click edit
//Clicking edit again to switch out of editmode swaps edit input value with p value

//Create delete function that selects the parent row node of the button to a variable, then 
//moves up to the next parent and removes that variable which is now the child

//Create a bind function that assigns click event handlers to the edit and delete functions
//use a for loop to go through each table row calling the bind function
