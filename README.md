# recipe-reactor
Create and analyze a recipe using JavaScript and the Nutritionix API with The Recipe Reactor.
To use the Recipe Reactor, simply enter a type of food and a quantity in cups.  The app will 
query the Nutritionix API and return the first match and associated nutritional information.
Clicking the analyze button will evaluate the nutritional data, add color coding to the table
and create a message explaining the analysis.  

To run the app locally, clone the repo, cd into the directory, install express by typing "npm install" in the terminal console and run the server with the command "node server.js"
